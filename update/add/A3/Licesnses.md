# Copyright and Licenses

Answer the following questions. Feel free to consult other sources to
help you answer these questions.

1. There are two basic categories of open-source licenses: copyleft and
   permissive. Which category ensures that all derivatives of the work will
   always have the same license?

2. Which category of license allows derivatives of the work to apply a
   different license to their new version?

3. Which category of license provides the most freedoms to their recipients?

4. Which category ensures that all recipients have the same rights on all
   derivations?

5. Which category is easier for a company to work with because they do not have
   to regularly audit their commits to ensure they are in compliance
   with licenses?

6. Which does not require a contributor to supply a copyright notice
   and a statement of how their contribution is licensed?

7. Use [TLDRLegal](https://tldrlegal.com/) to compare the MIT License (Expat)
   and GPLv3 (not LGPLv3).

   a. What does MIT allow that GPLv3 does not?

   b. What does GPLv3 require that MIT does not?

8. What is Linux kernel licensed under? Provide a link to a source that confirms
   your statement. What category of license is it?

9. When you contribute to an open source project, who owns the copy right
   for the contribution?

10. When you contribute to a project that is licensed under GPLv3, what
   license may you offer your changes under?

11. When you contribute to a project that is licensed under MIt, what license
   may you offer your changes under?

12. Read the
    [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/)
    (DCO).
    Linux requires its contributors to sign-off on this certificate for
    each contribution. What could go wrong if they didn't?

13. Read this
    [Contributor License Agreement](https://gist.github.com/pjcozzi/4d1ab2166519de7ba41b).
    Some project that are licensed under the MIT license require that
    its contributors agree to this CLA. Notice the CLA is similar to the
    DCO, but it also requires that the contribution be licensed under MIT.

    a. Why is it important that an MIT project use a CLA like this one?

    b. Why can the Linux kernel project get away with only using the DCO?

14. If you find code online that does not have a license, what can you
    do with it? Do you think that was the intent of the author? What can
    you do about it?
