# GitKit

GitKit is a 4 part set of lectures and activities. Each activity is
one part of this homework assignment.

By the time you read this, you will have already completed this assignment
by submitting your activity worksheets (MS Word documents) to Kodiak.
These are not graded critically. The purpose of this assignment is to
gain some basic terminology and experience working with Git and GitHub.

If you like, for your own organization, you may add your completed Word
documents in this directory in this repository. I will not regrade these.

## Practice

***What follows is NOT homework***, but are some questions to help you
study and practice.

1. Place the following steps in order to contribute a change to an
    open source project using the workflow we studied in class.

    * Make, stage, and commit changes
    * Clone fork by opening fork in GitPod
    * Create a pull request from fork to upstream
    * Create and switch to a feature branch
    * Push feature branch to origin

2. Place the following steps in order to update a merge request with
    new changes in upstream's main.

    * Synchronize local's and fork's main with upstream's main.
    * Resolve any conflicts.
    * Merge main into feature branch.
    * Push feature branch to fork.
    * Clone fork by opening fork in GitPod

3. Give a sequence of git commands to start a new feature branch named `feat`
    starting with the most recent copy of `main` in upstream. That means
    you need to first synchronize your local and fork's `main` with upstream's,
    before creating and switching to the new feature branch. You may assume
    no conflicts will occur.

4. Give a sequence of git commands to merge main into your feature
    branch named `feat`.

5. Git identifies each conflict in code using a specific syntax. Give an
    example of that syntax below. Try to do it from memory. If you can't,
    look at an example, and manually type it. This will help you remember
    what it looks like.

6. Get together with your team. Have one person play the role of maintainer.
    Have the maintainer create a public repository on GitLab. Then have
    the other team members fork it, create feature branches, make a change,
    and create a merge request. Then have the maintainer merge them. Have
    the other team members synchronize their forks, and offer another change
    on a new feature branch.

    Then switch roles so the maintainer can play the role of a contributor.

    Delete your repositories when you are done.
