# Markdown Homework

`gitkit.md` is an empty markdown file. Edit it, and create a study guide for GitKit.
Your study guide must make use of the following Markdown constructs.

- [ ] At least 2 levels of headings.
- [ ] Unordered list
- [ ] Ordered list
- [ ] Sub-list
- [ ] Code block (pre-formatted block)
- [ ] Horizontal rule.
- [ ] Bold text
- [ ] Italic text
- [ ] Bold and italic text
- [ ] A link to a website about Git or GitHub (e.g., a cheat-sheet, an article on how to resolve conflicts, etc.)
- [ ] A link to an image. (To upload an image in VS Code in GitPod or Codespace, drag your image file into the file-tree on the left.)

Tip: GitHub will render the [ ] in each item above as a checkbox (it's part of GitHub-Flavored Markdown). You can check of a box by placing an x in the box. Again, you'll only see it on GitHub. But you can use these in issues and PRs on GitHub!!!
